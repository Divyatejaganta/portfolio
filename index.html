      <p>
        [At Hewlett Packard Enterprise, my expertise lies in delivering tailored solutions for telecom applications, ensuring seamless integration with HP’s service management core. With a strong focus on system monitoring and optimizing bandwidth, I’ve significantly contributed to improving service quality management for Communication Service Providers (CSPs), providing real-time insights and robust support for Quality of Experience (QoE).
        As a Senior Technical Consultant, I lead training initiatives that emphasize compliance, performance consistency, and adherence to service delivery standards. My problem-solving approach involves analyzing issues from multiple angles and exploring corner cases to uncover potential challenges that might otherwise go unnoticed. By leveraging AI-driven analytics, I continuously innovate, tackle technical challenges, and build trust with each solution, driving proactive troubleshooting and pushing the boundaries of advanced business solutions.]
